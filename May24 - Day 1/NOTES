NOTE:

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE  VS  SCRIPTING LANGUAGE
=========================================================================================================================
JAVA Script is not basically designed to be a Programming Language. It was designed to be a SCRIPTING Language.
In a Proper Programming Language like in JAVA/C++ we cannot redeclare or Reassign a VALUE, whereas in JS we can do that, 
hence it is for this reason they say JS is a scripting Language and not a Programming Language.
